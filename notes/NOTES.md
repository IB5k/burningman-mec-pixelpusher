Tom Hallaran:
  Hey Wes - looping you in to the crew working on the car! Definitely someone in this group can answer some questions...
Alex Simone:
  Hey Wes this is Alex. I was out in Reno working with Tom on the car last weekend. Feel free to call or text with questions. I am Detroit based so I'm on Eastern time.
Wes Huelskamp:
  Wondering how you determined it has no spark or injector pulse?
Alex Simone:
  Honestly I am a bit unsure about spark, we did a visual test with the spark/coil pulled from cyl 1 and saw no arc, but it is sunny in Reno after all. For the injector pulse I put a noid light on cyl 8 injector and observed during the crank event...
Tom Hallaran:
  Pretty sure about spark 
Alex Simone:
  One fluke time when I had the light installed, it did light up, and during that particular crank event the engine started without any need for starter fluid
  Every other time the light was dark and the engine only cranked
  I wrote up a couple of summary emails that include some feedback I got from the garage techs where I work (including our product electronics guy). Happy to forward that info along if nobody else has yet.
Wes Huelskamp:
  Just curious because starting fluid is not going to magically make the injectors and coils work. I think its probably coincidence. 
  I think I just need to check it out for myself. Is the battery still charged up?
Tom Hallaran:
  Yeah battery is good
  But charger is removed
  Need to install the new one
  Hey Wes also the Haines manual for the Durango is in the big husky toolbox next to the fence...
Wes Huelskamp:
  Alright
  Im about to go get a starter for you. How do you know its been running hot? Where is the temp gauge?
Tom Hallaran:
  No temp gauge , it just quits out on the playa
  But more during the day 
Wes Huelskamp:
  Then it starts right back up? Or you have to wait awhile?
Tom Hallaran:
  We gotta wait
Wes Huelskamp:
  Dies randomly, no spark and no injector pulse - sounds more like a crankshaft position sensor issue. If the computer gets no signal from that sensor it won't be able to pulse injectors or fire plugs. Just a shot in the dark at this point since the data link connector doesn't work and I can't see any live data or trouble codes. I think I need to figure out how to get that working before anything. 
  Then you would be able to see the temperature via a scan tool as well. 
  Let me know if you want me to do that and I'll get going on it. 
Tom Hallaran:
  Sounds like a good plan
  I think the junction box under the chassis could be an issue
Wes Huelskamp:
  üëç
Tom Hallaran:
  The engine is under carpet as well as under that wood cover, lots of r value
Wes Huelskamp:
  Looks like you're correct. All the communication circuits run through one of those smaller connectors on that junction block. There's no signal on a couple of the circuits. We are going to need a new junction block before I can go any further. I can get the starter installed in the meantime. 
Tom Hallaran:
  Awesome - hopefully I am . Give me an address and I'll ship to you
  eBay one is 60 dollars 
  So I'd like to go with that V's the molar one
  Mopar one- is that good?
Wes Huelskamp:
  Yeah Mopar would be factory. Thats your best bet.

Jacob Ford:

Tom Hallaran:
  Wes got her starting so we should be able to move it forward to work on it this weekend! 
Alex Simone:
  Huzzah! Crank sensor did it?
  Or you mean with starter fluid and the new starter?
Wes Huelskamp:
  I started it around 15 times in the process of making sure it cranks every time with the key, so yes it definitely runs. Next step is to get the new junction block. Then I should be able to communicate with the computer and do proper diagnosis. 
Alex Simone:
  So was it the crank sensor?
Wes Huelskamp:
  I haven't replaced that yet. New starter today and had to figure out why it wouldn't start with the key, but did when I jumped power to the starter. 
  Once I can see all the live data from the sensors I will know more about the crank sensor. 
Alex Simone:
  Ok I see where you're at now, thanks

Tom Hallaran:
  Hey Wes jacob is trying to start the car with the key
  Is there something he needs to do?
Jacob Ford:
  File Transfer: IMG_2918.mov
Wes Huelskamp:
  Try holding the back of that connector tight while you crank it. There is a connection issue, which is why I‚Äôm going to wire in the starter switch. 
Jacob Ford:
  On it
  File Transfer: 58725752431__FB4A4574-B407-4B96-9555-02584061AA78.MOV
  Nice!
Tom Hallaran:
  As per Wes we should limit starting till he has push button working later this week
Wes Huelskamp:
  Got the oil changed, junction block installed, and the new starter switch wired in. It cranks consistently now, but decided it doesn‚Äôt want to start for me now. No spark or injector pulse. I back probed the crank sensor wires and verified it is sending a signal to the PCM, so that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the issue. All the injectors and coils have power, but its the PCM that directly controls them through a driver that grounds each one at a specific time. None of those control circuits are being grounded. Only thing I can figure is that the PCM is faulty ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Tom Hallaran:
  Uh oh
  Could the new block by faulty?
  What about the starter switch
  The green wire
  Maybe going through the relay is bad?
Wes Huelskamp:
  Made no difference with the old junction block. All the fuses in all the boxes are good. Wiggled tested all the wiring harnesses, still nothing. Not sure what happened between today and last week when I was here.
Tom Hallaran:
  Could it be battery?
  Could we try resetting ecm - take neg bat off - Turning key to on, leaving it for a while and putting key back on?
  Thanks for trying tonight
Wes Huelskamp:
  Already tried that multiple times. The battery is fully charged - don‚Äôt see that as a problem. 
Tom Hallaran:
  Ok will work on getting a new exam
  Ecm 
Wes Huelskamp:
  Sounds good. If you can send the payment for today to the same paypal that would be appreciated.
  Also I left the new junction block you bought in the box there in case you wanted to send it back.

  Tom Kim will be on site, seems like we ran into a problem today
Tom Kim:
  What's going on
Tom Hallaran:
  File Transfer: IMG_2548.jpg
  Sharing for awareness
Tom Kim:
  I could be the imobilizer If youre jumping the ignition key tumbler, there's a chip that needs to tell the immobilizer to give the signal to start and ground the coils 
Tom Hallaran:
  The SKIM module was removed
  It's not there (chip) - but if the pcm thinks it needs skim then I think the failure mode looks like this... 
  But we have no code reading ability so it's hard to verify anything 
Tom Kim:
  I think I'm here 
  File Transfer: IMG_20190817_113727_01.jpg
  Is this the spot?
Tom Hallaran:
  Yes
  Back lot
  https://www.garretttuning.com/products/chrysler-jeep-dodge-ecm-pcm-security-removal-skim-delete-programming
  That guy for example will take the skim off a pcm for $
  Maybe we can find a local service?
Tom Kim:

  Mailbox says Wright on it. Hide-a-key for gate lock is inside lawn mower under hood.
Tom Kim:

Tom Kim:
  File Transfer: IMG_20190817_120224_01.jpg
  Was this ecu replaced? 
  File Transfer: _20190817_121224.jpg
  I can't connect to it it's locked out. Where did this come from? Is the original key, dashboard, ecu around?
Tom Hallaran:
  Yes it was
  Junkyard  2 years ago
  You could try that
   Ode reader doesn't work we have not really tried cleaning it
  Code 
  Cleaning the port
Tom Kim:
  Did it work after replaced? This doesn't look like the original key if it's a 2006
Tom Hallaran:
  Yes it worked
  The skim module which does the key vin ecm handshake is also gone 
  There is no vin coded in the pcm
Jacob Ford:
  File Transfer: IMG_2920.MOV.3gp
Tom Hallaran:
  Which probably means it should not work after some set of starts amount other things
Tom Kim:
  Did it come with a matching key? Obd can't get in because of immobilizer
Tom Hallaran:
  No that's gone
  But also
  The SKIM module is gone that would even 'read ' the key
  This guy can remove skim from a pcm/ecm and is in Ohio
  https://www.garretttuning.com
  Maybe we can find someone local?
  It was starting with key and some shorted wires 3 days ago, then some wiring happened and then This
Tom Kim:
  Was the immobilizer removed to start?
  Which 3 wires?
Tom Hallaran:
  The SKIM unit was removed during same year as engine swap 
  The immobilizer is also part of pcm though
  Pcm is what dodge calls ecm/Ecuador in this car
Tom Kim:
  It's started 3 days ago without the aid of starting fluid? Im wondering how it even ran without the immobilizer 
Tom Hallaran:
  I'm not sure odb won't work at all in immobilizer engine
  http://www.obd2.com/support/reprog/downloads/chrysler/chry-skim_initial.pdf
  Immobilized will ask the dodge tuning /skim removal guy if he calls back
  It started for 3 years
  But our OBd has never worked
Tom Kim:
  So how does the ecu get signal to fire? If it's missing, it was bypassed we should dig deeper instead of getting a new one flashed 
  No even worried about obd we past that 
Tom Hallaran:
   Without a code reader this is really painful
  Yeah cool we'll the issue is the pcm now
  Well
  According to Wes who did the most recent work and is on this chain
  Ignition goes to pcm
  It's getting correct voltage from key assembly switch
  All coils and plugs etc are powered
  And pcm isn't grounding them like it should
  There is no spark/ no injector pulse - seems immobilized 
  This happened before
  And is why we swapped out the pcm 2 years ago
  Yesterday Wes tried installing a new junction block and put in the push button start
  You should be able to crank it now
  But I have not seen this personally
  But yeah - now starting using the turn key and squeeze wires method jacob sent in that video doesn't work 
Tom Kim:
  Ecu doesn't usually go bad its the last resort crank switch is useless when the ignition switch already hits the contactor for the starter. Idk why the bypass is nece6
  Necessary
  I'll do some poking around I have the manual and I'll look at the skid for ignition and security
Tom Hallaran:
  Ok. Just to restate we - don't have a vin, a pcm coded to vin, or the skim key reader immobilized component or a key with a chip in it 
  Good luck - let us know if there is anything we can do to help
Wes Huelskamp:
  The key would not crank the starter without holding the connector very specifically on the back of the ignition switch. If I wiggled and/or put pressure on the back of the ignition switch connector sometimes it would crank, and sometimes it wouldn't. This is why I installed the push button switch for the starter to bypass the ignition switch that was not working consistently. 
Tom Kim:
  Did I ever start after the push to start?
  There's a green wire cut off of the back of the ignition with a butt splice 
  File Transfer: IMG_20190817_130901_01.jpg
Wes Huelskamp:
  Thats what used to be connected to the starter.  
Tom Kim:
  File Transfer: IMG_20190817_130950_01.jpg
  Is that this green wire for the starter¬ø
Wes Huelskamp:
  Yes
  You can try hooking it back into the ignition switch, but like I said it was giving me issues. 
Tom Kim:
  Gonna work on obd
  Try to*
Wes Huelskamp:

Tom Hallaran:

Wes Huelskamp:
  Yeah but what did you do to make it run?
  It wasn't firing at all for me. 
Tom Kim:
  The green starter wire to the ignition tumbler. Wheres the nearest jyard? 
  We should get a new one and connector and resplice every wire
